# Heart-Disease-Prediction
# Overview
The main aim of this project is to predict that if a patient has heart disease or not based on various given features.

# About Dataset
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

# Content
Attribute Information: Columns descriptions as follows

age : age in years
sex : (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp: chest pain type (4 values)
trestbps: resting blood pressure : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2) : resting electrocardiographic results
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
exang : exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
target : 1 or 0, 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
